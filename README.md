The code has been written to analysis  public available datasets, for details see the first section of the SI.
The main point is, for each biome, joining the abundances OTU datasets, to produce the pearson correlation coefficients, and the phylogenetic ones. 
The analysis of the OTU's abudances can be carried out fully in the example code present in the folder starting by the  datasets that contains the data for many different biomes (CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA). 
For the time-series analysis we have used an other database that can be found in 
The phylogenetic analysis has been carried out by first producing the phylogentic tree for the OTU present in each community starting by the file  97_greengess.tree also  in the folder. Given that the production of the phylogenetic tree is a very long and tediouos work I have charged here already the output distance file for the Glacier biome to run an example of the analysis : https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/gzv2j64vt80p3a2afh0h7/AI-yMNHbbYUO3ttku9lflHI?rlkey=jknrigl6453vqn0wfay1fxe4y&st=qhkfh73s&dl=0
